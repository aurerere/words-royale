# Words Royale
In english class, we had to create or reinvent a multiplayer game *(with a computer or by using physical assets)*.
<br>
I decided to do a support to play a game that we call 
“[monkey quarters](https://teteamodeler.ouest-france.fr/jeux/le-quart-de-singe)” in France. 
<br>
I added a bluff mechanic, so I used an open API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
> it's a bit ugly, I'm sure it is the worst way to do it, and there are some user interface issues, 
but it was fun, and I'm proud of the result for the time I had.
